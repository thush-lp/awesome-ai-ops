Help make this the definitive directory of production-grade AI Ops tools!

## Selection Criteria

Tools must meet **most** of these:
✅ Open source (permissive licence: MIT, Apache2, BSD)
✅ Active (commits/releases last 12-18mo)
✅ Adopted (500+ GitHub stars OR known production use)
✅ Documented (quickstart works)
✅ Focused (solves one problem well)


## PR Requirements

1. **One tool per PR** (unless adding new category)
2. **Alphabetical order** within category file
3. **Required format**:

    ToolName – Brief description.
    GitHub Docs
    language:Python deploy:k8s focus:ml maturity:growing

4. **Required tags**: `language`, `deploy`, `focus` (see README legend)
5. **Neutral tone** – facts only, no marketing
